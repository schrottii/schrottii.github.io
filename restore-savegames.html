    <h1>Restoring Savegames</h1>
    <div style="background-color: red; color: black; font-size: 20px;">The old host shut down all my games. Here you can read how to rescue your savegames!<br /><a href="index.html">Click here to go back</a></div>

    <h1>Restoring Savegame</h1>
    <div class="gameDiv">
        It works about the same way for all 4 games. It might seem complicated but is actually very easy to do. <br />
        <b>NOTE: </b> It does NOT work if you did something that would normally also wipe your save, such as deleting browser data or clearing cookies! <br /><br />
        Here are the 7 steps to rescue your save on PC (for mobile, see the section below):<br />

        <div style="text-align: left">
            1. Copy the "command" for the game from its section below (the entire part in the green box. If you only copy parts of it, it does not work) <br />
            2. Open the game's old website <br />
            3. Open the console (F12 in Firefox, F12 then click Console in Chrome and Edge) <br />
            4. Paste the "command" for the game you're trying to get the save from (found below in the respective game's section) <br />
            5. Press enter and close the console (clicking an X button or pressing F12, usually) <br />
            6. Copy the (rescue) save appended at the bottom of the site entirely and store it somewhere (such as a .txt file) <br />
            7. Export it in the new hosted website, according to the short instructions described below. Done!

    <h1>Mobile</h1>
    <div class="gameDiv">
        Since mobile has no console by default, it needs to be done a bit differently. <a href="https://github.com/liriliri/eruda">With liriliri's eruda program, </a> it is possible to access the console on mobile, without any downloads or rooting required! <br />

        <div style="text-align: left">
            1. Create a new bookmark. The name does not matter <br />
            2. Set the address to the following, then save the bookmark: <br />
            <textarea class="command" id="mobile"></textarea> <br />
            3. Do steps 1-2 from the normal instructions (above) <br />
            4. Open the bookmark we have just created. This should add a little button in the bottom right. Click it to open the console <br />
            (Note: In Chrome you have to enter the bookmark's name in the search bar, instead of clicking it in the list of bookmarks) <br />
            5. Do steps 4-7 from the normal instructions (above). Done!
