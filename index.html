    <div style="background-color: red; color: black; font-size: 20px;">WARNING: None of my games are currently available (except for the FR APK) as the host suddenly decided to shut them down. It might take a few days until I have migrated them to a new host. I will try re-enabling their current sites for a short period so everyone can get their saves.</div>
    <p>This website for my games is under construction...</p>
